# Eroding_program
A little App that creates a programm for an eroding machine 

When the program is finished, the user should only have to enter a few basic data and then receives as output a "program sequence" which he can enter into his EDM machine! Additionally the user should be able to choose between three geometries: rectangle, circle and a kind of an eight.
